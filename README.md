Here is a detailed, section-by-section explanation of the advanced Python code. This guide will help you understand not just what the code does, but why specific choices were made.

High-Level Overview
This script builds a sophisticated fraud detection system by combining two powerful modern techniques:

Tabular Data Analysis: It uses a high-performance model (LightGBM) to analyze structured data like claim amounts, policy age, etc.
Advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP): Instead of just counting keywords, it uses a deep learning model (Sentence-BERT) to understand the meaning and context of the textual descriptions of the incidents.
The final and most impressive step is using Explainable AI (XAI) with SHAP to understand and visualize why the model flags a claim as fraudulent.

Section-by-Section Code Explanation
Section 1: Data Loading and Basic Cleanup
Generated python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
# ... other imports

print("\n1. Loading and Cleaning Data...")
df = pd.read_csv('insurance_claims.csv')
df.replace('?', np.nan, inplace=True)
df.drop(columns=[...], inplace=True)
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Python
What it does: This section loads the insurance_claims.csv file into a pandas DataFrame, which is the standard tool for working with tabular data in Python.
Key Steps & Why:
df.replace('?', np.nan, inplace=True): The dataset uses a question mark '?' to represent missing data. Machine learning models can't work with this. We replace it with np.nan (Not a Number), which is the standard representation for missing values that data science libraries understand.
df.drop(...): We remove columns that are not useful for prediction.
policy_number, _c39: These are identifiers or empty columns with no predictive value.
policy_bind_date, incident_date: These require complex time-series feature engineering which is out of scope for a quick, high-impact model.
incident_location: This is a "high-cardinality" feature (too many unique values). Encoding it would create thousands of new columns, making the model slow and inefficient. It's better to drop it.
Section 2: Advanced NLP with Sentence-BERT Embeddings
Generated python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import torch

nlp_model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
text_embeddings = nlp_model.encode(df['incident_details'].tolist(), ...)
embedding_features = pd.DataFrame(text_embeddings, ...)
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Python
What it does: This is the first major advanced step. It converts the text in the incident_details column into meaningful numerical vectors called embeddings.
Key Concepts & Why:
The Old Way (TF-IDF): Simply counts how often words appear. It doesn't understand context. The phrases "My car hit a pole" and "A pole was struck by my vehicle" would look very different.
The New Way (Sentence-BERT): This uses a pre-trained transformer model. It has been trained on a massive amount of text and understands the semantic meaning of words and sentences.
It knows that "car" and "vehicle" are similar.
It understands that the two sentences above describe the same event.
How it works: nlp_model.encode() takes each incident description and converts it into a vector of 384 numbers (for this specific 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' model). These numbers capture the "meaning" of the sentence. The output embedding_features is a table where each row corresponds to a claim and the columns are these 384 vector values. This allows the machine learning model to "understand" the text.
Section 3: Feature Engineering and Preprocessing Pipeline
Generated python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
# ...

categorical_features = ...
numerical_features = ...

numerical_transformer = Pipeline(...)
categorical_transformer = Pipeline(...)

preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(...)
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Python
What it does: This section sets up a professional, robust workflow to prepare the tabular data for the model. It handles missing values and converts categorical data into a numerical format.
Key Concepts & Why (This is a modern best practice):
Pipeline: Chains multiple preprocessing steps together (e.g., first impute missing values, then scale the data).
ColumnTransformer: This is the master tool. It applies the correct pipeline to the correct columns. We create one pipeline (numerical_transformer) for number columns and another (categorical_transformer) for text category columns.
SimpleImputer: Fills in missing np.nan values. We use the average (mean) for numbers and the most common value (most_frequent) for categories.
OneHotEncoder: Machine learning models don't understand text like "Honda" or "Audi". One-hot encoding converts a column like auto_make into multiple new binary (0/1) columns, e.g., auto_make_Honda, auto_make_Audi.
Benefit: This approach prevents data leakage (a common error where information from the test set accidentally influences the training process) and makes your code cleaner and more reproducible.
Section 4: Combine Features and Finalize Dataset
Generated python
X_tabular_processed = preprocessor.fit_transform(X)
# ...
X_final = pd.concat([X_tabular_df, embedding_features], axis=1)
X_final.columns = [...] # Clean column names
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Python
What it does: It takes the processed tabular data from the pipeline and merges it with the NLP embeddings from Section 2.
Why: The result, X_final, is the master feature set. It contains every piece of information (both tabular and text-based) that the model will use to make its predictions. The last line cleans up the column names because some libraries (like LightGBM) can have trouble with special characters.
Section 5: Model Training with LightGBM
Generated python
import lightgbm as lgb

scale_pos_weight = y_train.value_counts()[0] / y_train.value_counts()[1]
lgbm = lgb.LGBMClassifier(objective='binary', scale_pos_weight=scale_pos_weight, ...)
lgbm.fit(X_train, y_train)
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Python
What it does: This section trains the machine learning model to distinguish between fraudulent and non-fraudulent claims.
Key Concepts & Why:
LightGBM: We use LightGBM instead of a more basic model like RandomForest. It is a gradient boosting model, known for being extremely fast and highly accurate. It's a favorite in data science competitions and a great choice for a hackathon.
scale_pos_weight: This is the most important parameter here. Fraud datasets are imbalanced (e.g., 900 normal claims and only 100 fraud claims). Without this parameter, the model could achieve 90% accuracy by just guessing "not fraud" every time. scale_pos_weight tells the model to pay much more attention to the rare fraud cases during training, forcing it to learn what they look like.
Section 6: Performance Evaluation
Generated python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, roc_auc_score

print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred, ...))
print(f"ROC AUC Score: {roc_auc_score(y_test, y_proba):.4f}")
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Python
What it does: It measures how well the trained model performs on data it has never seen before (the test set).
Key Metrics & Why:
Accuracy is not enough. For imbalanced data, you must look at other metrics.
classification_report: This gives you:
Precision: Of all the claims we predicted as fraud, how many were actually fraud? (Measures the quality of the predictions).
Recall: Of all the actual fraud cases, how many did we successfully catch? (Measures the completeness of the predictions).
roc_auc_score: This is an excellent overall metric that measures the model's ability to distinguish between the two classes. A score of 0.5 is random guessing, and 1.0 is a perfect classifier.
Section 7: Explainable AI (XAI) with SHAP
Generated python
import shap

explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(lgbm)
shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X_test)
shap.summary_plot(shap_values[1], X_test, ...)
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Python
What it does: This is the "wow" factor for your presentation. It explains the "black box" model. Instead of just saying a claim is fraudulent, it tells you which factors contributed to that decision and by how much.
Key Concepts & Why:
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations): It uses a concept from game theory to calculate the exact contribution of each feature to each individual prediction.
TreeExplainer: A specific SHAP tool that is highly optimized for tree-based models like LightGBM.
shap.summary_plot: This visualizes the SHAP values. The "beeswarm" plot is the most powerful:
Each dot is a person/claim from your test set.
Y-axis: Lists the most important features.
X-axis: The SHAP value. A positive value means that feature pushed the prediction towards "Fraud". A negative value pushed it towards "Not Fraud".
Color: Shows the feature's original value (e.g., red for high claim amount, blue for low).
How to Read the Plot: You can make powerful statements like: "As we can see, high values of total_claim_amount (red dots) have a high positive SHAP value, meaning they are a strong indicator of fraud. Conversely, a high months_as_customer (red dots) has a negative SHAP value, indicating that long-term customers are less likely to be fraudulent."
